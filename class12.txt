1. Star Pusher
- Level design: using external source (files)
  Often, you want the game to be able to load different maps/levels. 
  Since the game play itself is same for all levels, it makes sense
  to use some external sources to encode them rather than writing them directly
  in the program. This way you can have part of team creating the game 
  content and not worrying about programming! In this game, the levels
  are simple text files, so you can just use a text editor to create
  game contents.

  This is also a common practice to reduce the complexity of game making.

1. Star Pusher
-----------------------------
This is a "box pusher" type of puzzle game (e.g. Sokoban). You can only push,
not pull, boxes. Once a box is pushed into a corner and cannot move, the level
has to be restarted.

What to download:
- All files are in one zip archive: starPusherImages.zip: http://invpy.com/starPusherImages.zip
  After the download, You need to unzip the zip file.

- What is in it: 
  - The python program: startpusher.py:  http://invpy.com/starpusher.py
  - The level file: starPusherLevels.txt: http://invpy.com/starPusherLevels.txt
  - Some images (sprites) (Total 18 of them).

- To run it: in IDLE, open the file starpusher.py and press F5.

How to play it:
--------------
Use arrow keys to move
key 'p' to change player image
Backspace to reset current level
'n' for next level
'b' for back a level
Escape to quit
a/s/d/w to move camera (only useful when the map is bigger than screen)

Play
----
Play a few levels, and then think about what kind of changes (a.k.a. mods)
you would like to see. 

If a level is too hard, you can go back to the starPusherLevels.txt
and modify the level design. The format of the levels file is actually
very simple:
; http://sokobano.de/wiki/index.php?title=Level_format
;   @ - The starting position of the player.
;   $ - The starting position for a pushable star.
;   . - A goal where a star needs to be pushed.
;   + - Player & goal
;   * - Star & goal
;  (space) - an empty open space.
;   # - A wall.
;   ; - comment. a blank line signals a new level

More levels are at http://sneezingtiger.com/sokoban/levels.html

Choose 'View as text' to see the text format. You can cut and paste
a design, save it as a file, and rename it 'starPusherLevels.txt'
and restart the game. Or simply modify the starpusher.py program
to replace the levels file name to the one you just saved. Now you can play
levels other people designed. Or you can design your own level.

I also included a different set of levels (in sasquatch.py and sasquatchLevels.txt - download them in class12_files)

Exercise:
--------

- Use a text editor to create one level yourself.

- Think about ways to improve the game play. Does an 'undo' command help?
  Is it possible to quickly tell the player they made a 'dead end' move?
