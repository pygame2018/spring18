1. What is Animation
--------------------
Draw a sequence of (slightly) different pictures over time.
Frames per second (FPS)

2. The Memory Puzzle
--------------------
At https://github.com/pygame2018/spring18/class2_files/memorypuzzle.py
Load the file into IDLE and run it. Or just type python memorypuzzle.py
at command line.

This is a simple game to illustrate the following point:
- Data structures:
    A list of icons board[box_x][box_y] (contains shape/color pairs),
    revealed[box_x][box_y]
- Basic game flow:
    setup the board -> wait for events -> handle events (reveal or not)
    -> redraw the board -> check win/lose -> wait again
- The board is often a grid, so use a nested loop to
  draw all the elements
  Note the difference between these two:

# column by column             |  # row by row
for x in [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]:      |  for y in ['a', 'b', 'c']:     
    for y in ['a', 'b', 'c']:  |      for x in [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]: 
        print(x, y)            |          print(x, y)           

- Mouse events: type and position (x,y) 
   MOUSEMOTION
   MOUSEBUTTONUP (or MOUSEBUTTONDOWN. What's the difference?)
   The position is relative to the top-left corner of the window,
   so you will need to figure out which box the mouse clicked,
   - see the function getBoxAtPixel(mousex, mousey)

3. Can you fix it?
------------------
Here are some "buggy" versions of the program. The difference is often
caused by just one line! Download and run the buggy program, and try
to fix it!

You can start with the error messages, which give you important clues
(but not always).

Filename               - Symptom
--------                 -------
memorypuzzle_buggy1.py - Graphics are messed up.
memorypuzzle_buggy2.py - IndexError: list index out of range
memorypuzzle_buggy3.py - Box highlight lags
memorypuzzle_buggy4.py - icons don't show up
memorypuzzle_buggy5.py - NameError: global name 'getRandomizedBoard' is not defined
memorypuzzle_buggy6.py - Box hide/reveal animation is very choppy.
memorypuzzle_buggy7.py - No gaps are showing up on the board.
memorypuzzle_buggy8.py - TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not iterable
