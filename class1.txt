Starting today we are going to make some GUI-based python games using
the pygame package.

1. Install Pygame
-----------------
Following instructions on Chapter 1 of 'Making Games with Python & Pygame'.
Or, follow http://pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted

Basically, if you already have python or python3 recently installed, you
can use the built-in 'pip' installer. Just do:
python3 -m pip install pygame --user
(use python if you don't have python3).

To see if it works, run one of the includes examples:
python3 -m pygame.examples.aliens

2) Basics of GUI Programming Concepts
------------------------------------- 
Unlike the terminal-based command line interface (CLI). Graphical User
Interface is based on events (like keyboard/mouse actions) passed into
the program by the system and processed by the program.

So, you (the user) produces events; the events are forwarded to the
applications; the application basically just loops forever waiting for
the events - and when the events do come, repaint the window accordingly.

Usually the application keeps a 'conceptual' drawing of the things to
be drawn - this is called the 'state'. The actually drawing is thus
just derived from the the conceptual state by incorporating the user
inputs (information passed by the events).

Other concepts:
FPS: Frames per second
Color - as tuples (R, G, B) or (R, G, B, T)
Coordinate system - (x, y) and dimensions (width, height)
- top, left, bottom, right, centerx, centery
Surface (display) - think them as a canvas
- you can draw shapes on a canvas, using Constructors
- texts are a little difficult - think the

3) Drawing and Animation
------------------------
This is a demo program to show the various things to be drawn:

This include: (More on http://pygame.org/docs)
- background fill
- text
- shapes like polygon, line, circle, ellipse, rect
- and a black pixel (can you find it?)
